Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that emphasizes the separation of concerns and the independence of an application's business rules from the external frameworks and technologies it utilizes. It provides a structured approach to software development, promoting code maintainability, testability, and scalability.

Developed by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), Clean Architecture focuses on designing systems that are flexible, adaptable, and resistant to changes in requirements or technology choices. It encourages developers to create software that can evolve independently, with minimal impact on other parts of the system.
